To grab all reports:

Open http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/e/environmental/programs--services/water-quality

Array.prototype.slice.call($('.contentBlox')[1].querySelectorAll('a'), 1).map(function (a) { return a.href })

Gives us an array of urls

Do the same thing for the results:

Array.prototype.slice.call($('.contentBlox')[1].querySelectorAll('a'), 2).map(function (a) { return a.href })

Now you can run cleanup to generate a school structure in `schools/ULCS/{results,reports}`

The script will warn you for things you need to do manually.

** Check pdf sizes, for some reason some of the links don't work on the school district's page. Surprise **


 ** Childs has the wrong ULCS on its results pdf, so ended up in the wrong directory. Move to 2260 **

* Investigate output CSV because things like 4020-overbrook mess things up... what's w/ the arrow"
