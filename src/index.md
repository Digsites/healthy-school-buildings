View schools on the Facility Conditions page by clicking one of the bubbles.

Bubble size reflects school student population as of the 2015-2016 school year.

Bubble color is related to the <em>"Facility Condition Index" [FCI]</em>, an industry-standard
measurement of a facility's condition and is typically expressed as a percent.
The FCI is the ratio of the cost to correct a facility's deficiencies called
the <em>“Condition Assessment Cost” [CAC]</em>, (i.e.the amount in millions of $$
required to adequately fix the school) to the Current Replacement Value (CRV),
also referred to as the <em>"Replacement Value."</em> The CRV represents the
hypothetical total cost of rebuilding or replacing an existing facility in current
dollars to its optimal condition under current codes and construction methods.

  A school FCI value of:
  <ul>
    <li>&lt; 15% is considered good condition;</li>
    <li>15% - 30% is fair condition;</li>
    <li>31% - 60% is poor; </li>
    <li>60% - 75% is very poor condition; </li>
    <li>&gt; 75% is critical condition</li>
