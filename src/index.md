View schools on the map by clicking one of the school bubbles.

The bubble size on the map reflects the school student population as of the 2015-2016 school year;  bubble color is related to a number called the "Facility Condition Index" [FCI], an industry-standard measurement of a facility's condition. It is typically expressed as a percent; the higher the value the worse the school condition is.

You can type in a school name to search for a specific school.

It is also possible to narrow search criteria by selecting filter options.
